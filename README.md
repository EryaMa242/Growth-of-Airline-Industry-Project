# CSE 163 Project

After you open the folder:
* First run cse163_utility.py
* Then run project_code.py
* Last run final_project_test.py which will generate multiple graphs

Question 1: What is the trend of revenue passengermiles of each type of operation? 
Which year has the highest RPM? Which yearhas the lowest RPM?
* Run convert_money, plt_rpm_trend_each_operation, rpm_year_sum(dataframe), plt_rpm_year_sum,
rpm_year_highest, rpm_year_lowest in project_code to get result. Then run
test_rpm_year_sum, test_rpm_year_highest, test_rpm_year_lowest in final_project_test
to test the result.

Question 2: Which type of aircraft(small narrowbodies, large narrowbodies, widebodies, fleet)
has the highestsalary for a pilot over the years?
* Run convert_money, load_data_and_clean in cse163_utility. Then run salary_of_aircrafts
in project_code to get the result.

Question 3: Is there any correlation between salaries and each type of employee position
* Run salary_employee_position in project_code to visualize the result.
